# A_Reinforcement_Learning_Approach_to_the_Design_of_Quantum_Chains_for_Optimal_Energy_Transfer

This repository contains data for ["A Reinforcement Learning Approach to the Design of Quantum Chains for Optimal Energy
Transfer"](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.07561). 
We also include our codes to train the RL agents: notice that we did not set random seeds, hence training and possibly final results might slightly differ from those presented in the manuscript. For this reason, we also include our trained network models for agents that are more difficult/require more time to train.

The codes are known to be compatible with python: 3.9.7, numpy: 1.20.3, scipy: 1.7.1, matplotlib: 3.4.3, tensorflow: 2.7.0.
